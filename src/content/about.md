Hi there, my name is Jeremy Tan and I'm a programmer. Programming is both my job and my hobby, so to be honest, I don't do much else; I read for an hour or two a day, game a bit on Sundays and get some exercise in here and there -
that's about all there is to my daily life.

As for what I'm doing as a programmer, I'm currently part way through a multi-year project. This year (2018), I plan to release several libraries and tools to lay the foundation for my project's end goal.

I get a quite a kick out of putting systems together, and am really excited about the year ahead. I have a lot to learn, and hopefully, a lot to share. This blog is my platform for documenting and sharing things.
I sincerely hope that you find it to be of value.

My contact can be found [here](/contact).

My name is Jeremy Tan ChongDao (JeremyTCD) and I'm a software engineer. At present, I'm part way through a multi-year project. Last year (2018), I began laying the foundation for 
my project by building several tools. This year (2019), I plan to release some of those tools and to start working on several more. I get a kick out of putting systems together 
and am really excited about the year ahead. My technical journey can be followed at [www.jering.tech](https://www.jering.tech). The site that you're currently viewing is my personal blog.
I might ramble about non-software related issues here. I hope you find my writing to be of use.

My name is Jeremy Tan ChongDao (JeremyTCD) and I'm a software engineer. At present, I'm part way through a multi-year project. Last year (2018), I began laying the foundation for my project by 
building several tools. This year (2019), I plan to release some of those tools and to work on several more. I get a kick out of putting systems together and am excited about the year ahead. 
You can follow my technical journey at [www.jering.tech](https://www.jering.tech). The site you're viewing is my personal blog. I ramble about things unrelated to software here. I hope you find my writing to be of use.

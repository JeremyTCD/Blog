# About
My name is Jeremy Tan and I'm a programmer. Programming is both my job and my hobby, so to be honest, I don't do much else; I read for an hour or two a day, game a bit on Sundays and get some exercise in here and there -
that's about all there is to my daily life.

As for what I do as a programmer, I'm currently a third of the way through a multi-year project. This year (2018), I plan to release several supporting libraries and tools. I get a huge
kick out of putting systems together, piece by piece, and am really excited about the year ahead.

I have a lot to learn, and hopefully, a lot to share. This blog is my platform for documenting and sharing things. I sincerely hope that you find it to be of value.

If you are looking for my contact, you can find it [here](/contact.html).

# How I Think
Before getting into my rationale, I'd like to share a bit about how I think.

## Logic
- premise > conclusion
- as a child, thought knowledge was the limiting factor
- learnt that some minds are governed by emotions, reverse rationalization
- learnt that it has been decomposed into a science

## Depth of Thought
Getting to the root of the problem. Forming a connected thought sequence that leads to the root issue. E.g what to study?
- define train of thought
- create train of thought to what to study

## Breadth of Thought
Broadening the scope of consideration to include more variables.
When my mind approaches a problem, it does so at multiple scopes. For instance, if ants begin to infest my kitchen and I decide to get rid of them, my mind would approach the problem at these scopes:

- At the smallest scope, there are only the ants before me and myself. Within this scope, the solution is obvious - to remove the ants, I should kill them. 
- At a slightly larger scope, there are the ants, myself, and the ant nest. Within this scope, the solution is no longer to kill the ants outright. Instead, the solution is
to give them some bait, follow them back to their nest, and poison the ant nest. 
- At an even larger scope, there are the ants, myself, the ant nest, and the surroundings. Within this scope, part of the solution is still to poison the ant nest, but on top of that, the solution involves sealing up
gaps to prevent ants from starting new nests, figuring out what the ants feed on and thinking up a plan to keep the area free of such tid bits.

While this example is trivial, it clearly illustrates a key takeaway: solving a problem with a large scope (the *big picture*) in mind often leads to a more lasting and complete solution. The downside to being a big picture thinking
is that people often do not understand my actions. Indeed, if someone were to observe me trailing ants back to their hole in the wall, they might think my actions odd. This article attempts to explain the scopes from which I 
approach problems.

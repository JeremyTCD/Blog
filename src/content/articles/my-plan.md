This article describes the following: the rationale for my plan, my plan, and factors that could impinge on my plan. 
Essentially, this article describes the context within which I make decisions, in an attempt to make it easier for others to understand my actions and choices. 

! #### Edit - Jan 4, 2019  
! This article was originally written for the benefit of my family. I kept it hidden on this blog. Now that I'm making it accessible, I should provide some context.  
!
! Where I'm from (Singapore), technical pursuits like software engineering are [unpopular](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shrinking-pool-of-engineers-poses-national-risk). 
! A university tutor of mine once asked for a show of hands from those who specified computing as their first choice. Only 1 other student and I raised our hands in a class of about 20. 
! In recent years, the government [has been trying](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-built-on-the-backs-of-engineers-but-still-has-a-long-w-7906872) to fix this. 
! Unfortunately, there is still a stigma against technical pursuits. Many Singaporeans, including my family, have a rabid obsession with a handful of professions like medicine and law.  
!
! Sometime back, I left the nest in search of a more conducive work environment. Due to high property prices, moving out before getting married is quite atypical in Singapore. 
! The questions came. My verbal responses did not satisfy them (as has been the case since I was a teen). I figured I'd write an article explaining in no uncertain terms, 
! what I am doing and why. This way they'd have something to stew over without bothering me (I say this half in jest, I am grateful for their concern). To their credit, they've actually 
! come around to my point of view and I no longer dread their company.  
!
! Anyway, that is the context for this article. I wrote it in haste for my family. This includes my dear parents, who believe dinosaurs are a myth created by Satan and think Trump is the 
! messiah. As such, this article is quite utilitarian - it is no paragon of literary excellence. Technical details are sparse. Nonetheless, it has helped those around me to understand me 
! better. I hope that you find it to be of use.

## The Rationale
The rationale for my plan is based on a train of thought I had when I was in my teens. This section journeys through that train of thought. 

### Why do I Exist?
Like any child, I pondered long and hard over the reasons (or lack thereof) for my existence. Only my conclusion matters in this article: I 
decided that I exist to contribute to the betterment of mankind.

### How Can I Contribute to the Betterment of Mankind?
Again, only my conclusion to this question matters to this article: I decided that I would better mankind by contributing to the colonization of space.

### How Can I Contribute to the Colonization of Space?
While intrigued by the technical side of things, what caught my attention was how little was spent on research into space exploration. Budgetary constraints were clearly 
a major impediment to progress in the field. I decided that the best way I could contribute would be to first accumulate capital, then fund and participate in research.

! In recent years, enlightened men with material and intellectual capital like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have begun pursuing and promoting the colonization of space. It is heartening to know that there 
! are other humans who share my views. Nonetheless, for reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, I still believe that accumulating capital gives me the best chance of making a significant contribution.

### How Can I Accumulate Capital?
To answer this question, I began reading up about the super wealthy. I looked for patterns, especially amongst those who made their wealth under similar conditions to my own. Amongst the young, self-made, super wealthy, 
many were techies. A good number sold software products and services. The question was then: what is it about selling software that enables quick accumulation of capital? My conclusions were as follows:

- Software products are easy to distribute globally. The day a product goes live, it has a potential market of several billion - 
basically anyone with an internet connection. Many other industries, like the medical industry, require physical proximity.
- Software products have minimal marginal cost. For example, it probably costs Microsoft less than a cent to create a new product key when someone purchases a copy of windows.
- Software products can have deep technical competitive advantage. Products with deep technical competitive advantage are easy to export.  

! There is a category of software products that I refer to as *concept-based products*. Examples of concept-based products are services like Redmart and Deliveroo. These products aren't trivial to put together, but they are 
! not examples of technical ingenuity. Their focus is not
! on technical innovation, instead, their focus is on applying existing tech to common business models like selling groceries or delivering food. These kinds of software products do not appeal to me for the following reasons:
! - Anybody with sufficient resources can duplicate such products. Indeed, it often becomes a question of who has more capital.
! - The growth of such products is typically dependent on local market size. While the regional market in SEA has begun to look enticing in recent years, any player here is still a minnow next to the giants in NA and China.
! It is extremely hard for concept-based products in SEA to grow into globally dominant products.
!
! In short, concept-based products lack deep technical competitive advantage. Examples of software products with deep technical advantage are systems like [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com.sg/products/autocad/overview),
! [Lyrebird](https://lyrebird.ai/), and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Such products marry advanced technical concepts such as advanced physics with top-notch software engineering. 
! These tools are incredibly hard to duplicate. Additionally, growth in their adoption is completely independent of local market size; a high-quality deep tech product built in a country with a small local market, like
! Singapore, can be globally dominant. These are the kinds of software products that appeal to me.

Software was a great fit for my situation:

- Singapore has a really small market. I knew that the software industry would provide the best platform for me to reach a global audience. 
- I knew that I would be working with very limited material capital. The software industry is one within which intellectual capital alone can earn success.
- I loved logic based subjects and I loved making things. I knew that writing software was something that I could do for the rest of my life.

Apart from programming, I saw being an "investor" as an alternative means of accumulating capital. Investing can yield exponential returns and is not constrained by physical proximity. In addition,
some of the men I respect, like Warren Buffet, are investors. I concluded that I would try to learn more about the finance industry, but my heart has always been in software development and building a
company.

## The plan
### Overview
I've had a plan since I was a teen. Not everything has gone to plan, but I've learnt from my mistakes, adjusted, and am well on my way. The following is an overview of my plan, note that phases aren't necessarily sequential 
(they can run in parallel):

#### Phase: Raise an Initial Sum
I knew that I would need funds to support myself and to invest in my ideas. Immediately after leaving Junior College, I began teaching tuition. At the same time, I learnt 
basic stuff about investing. I saved every cent and invested most of what I earnt.

#### Phase: Learn How to Develop Commercially Viable Software
This part of my plan began when I bought my first programming books as a teen. Since then, I have been learning, working on small projects and making gradual progress. This is an extremely broad phase of my plan 
as building commercially viable software is non-trivial. At present, this is the phase I am in. The following are some details on this phase.

##### How I Learn:
- I figure out what to learn by looking through university curriculums. For example, Standford [lists](http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/#majorstext) the modules for many of their courses. Such
university curriculums were especially useful early on. They made me aware of foundational subjects like discrete mathematics and algorithms and datastructures.
- I read textbooks. Most of my foundational knowledge (theoretical stuff) was obtained from textbooks. I set aside time to read at least 1 textbook a year, both to prepare for specific tasks and to 
broaden my skillset. Last year, I read [Database Systems Concepts](http://db-book.com/). This year, I intend to read the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). Textbooks are long and dense, but they 
provide a thorough grounding at an expedited pace and next to no material cost. For me, reading a good textbook is a far more efficient way to learn than going to school.
- I read books. Books tend to focus on specialized knowledge, for instance, they might cover a specific tool or a niche topic. They are shorter than textbooks and I typically read them as and when I need to learn something specific.
For example, I've been looking for tips on making my code as performant as possible, so a couple of weeks ago, I pre-ordered 
[Writing High-Performance .Net Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BF68842/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and will be reading it once it's out.
- I browse forums. Every morning, immediately after waking up, I scan through Reddit (I only subscribe to software and tech-related stuff). I typically read one or two articles, comments,
look at a project or two and bookmark whatever I can't finish for later. This habit keeps me up to date with bleeding edge technology. For example, 
[Global Azure Bootcamp 2018](https://github.com/MSDEVMTL/GlobalAzureBootcamp2018), a "bootcamp" on Microsoft's cloud offerings, is in my bookmark bar right now.
- I read through code written by others. Many big companies open source their code (typically, their business models use ads or add-on services to generate revenue). For example, the source code for [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium)
is open source and was a great resource when I was trying to understand the limitations of certain languages. I spend a decent amount of time looking through code written by others, mostly when I am trying to utilize other 
people's libraries.
- I read through documentation for tools and products. Documentation can range from one page to several hundred pages. The last major tool I read up on was [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html).
On a side note, Elasticsearch is the kind of product that I am working toward at this point in time.
- I google. I spend a good amount of time googling for specialized knowledge and reading whatever pops up, like blog articles.

##### How I Keep Track of My Pace:
- I use a simple app called [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track my work hours. I count hours spent [in the zone](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/emily-hill/what-it-really-means-to-b_b_10300610.html) as work hours. 
Being in the zone refers to a state of mind where everything irrelevant melts away. It is similar to one's state of mind when taking a math exam or playing competitive sports.  At present, I aim for 5.5 work hours per day, 
6 days a week. This is about third more than what most programmers clock. I achieve this by keeping my non-work life as simple as possible.
- I track the number of *contributions* I make. Essentially, a contribution is a unit of work, like writing some code or finding some bug. My contributions can be viewed on my [Github page](https://github.com/JeremyTCD). 
Something interesting to note is that, in terms of number of contributions, I am amongst the top few hundred on Github (a site with over 20 million users). Not everybody works on projects hosted on Github and contributions can vary 
in size, quality and complexity, but I do write a lot of code.

#### Phase: Build Commercially Viable Software
After picking up the requisite skills. I intend to build commercially viable software. 

##### How long does it take to build a piece of commercially viable software?  
Consider the following applications:
- Instagram: Relative to many technical products, Instagram is comparatively simple, nonetheless, there is quite a bit going on under the hood. It was built by two Standford graduates and took about a year to 
reach its first launch (started out late 2009 as Burbn, launched in October 2010). It could take a good developer up to 2 years to build such a product (with the same level of polish).
- Parking.sg: A team led by LHL's son [spent over a year building the parking.sg](https://www.tech.gov.sg/technews/digitalgov/2018/04/this-govtech-team-is-the-reason-you-no-longer-have-to-use-paper-parking-coupons)
 (mid 2016 to October 2017). Parking.sg includes computer vision technology, was built for multiple platforms and has to interface with government services. A system like this could take a good developer
several years to build, test, and launch as a polished commercial product.
- Minecraft: Notch (the creator of Minecraft) spent [a year and a half](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/xfzdg/i_am_markus_persson_aka_notch_creator_of/) working alone on the early versions of Minecraft. 
He wrote his own game engine, so his efficiency is quite respectable.

##### What kind of software do I intend to build?  
The tech scene exhibits a phenomenon that I call the *ebb and flow of opportunity*. Every once in awhile, a new technology creates opportunities for small developers. Over time, those who are successful
consolidate their gains and make it difficult for small developers to enter the market. For example, when online shopping first became viable, the internet was littered with small stores. Over time, the market has consolidated 
into large, generalists like IHerb and Amazon - making it hard for small developers to enter the market. The same thing happened in mobile application development - initially, small developers could easily 
gain global recognition for apps. Eventually, those who were successful grew so big and efficient that it became hard for small developers to enter the market. I was not technically capable enough to ride the mobile application
wave. At present, I am attempting to pre-empt the next burst of opportunity. More details on my efforts can be found [below](http://localhost:8080/articles/my-plan#what-im-working-on-right-now).

#### Phase: Start a Company, Build a Team
Once I have a profit-generating piece of software, I intend to start a company and build a team. This phase and the last phase will get fleshed out as they get closer.
I do have some ideas for them but these ideas are outside the scope of this article.

#### Phase: Move On to Other Sectors
Once I have enough capital to venture into other sectors, I intend to do so. I look forward to being able to explore other fields.

### Immediate Plan
The section above provides an overview of my plan. This section describes my immediate plan:

#### Overview
As mentioned earlier, I am attempting to pre-empt the next burst of opportunity. Browsers have begun shipping a technology called [web assembly](http://webassembly.org/), it allows developers to build extremely performant 
websites. Also, it allows developers to develop websites using their environment of choice (environment refers to a language or a group of languages, and the tooling and libraries that exist for them). Web assembly
is incomplete but has good momentum. My opinion is that it will become the foundation for building cross-platform applications. At present, companies often build completely separate user-interface applications for android, ios, the web 
and so on. In addition, they build backend services using a variety of environments. Web assembly will allow companies to build a single, cross-platforam, user-interface application using their environment of choice.
Also, they will be able to build backend services using the same environment. This will translate into significant and tangible savings on development. Some implications of this are:
- The old environment for developing websites will decline in popularity.
- Some other environments are going to fill the gap. 

I am betting on an environment called *.Net* (the reasons why are beyond the scope of this article). In anticipation of .Net's rise, I am currently developing tools for it. These tools do stuff like 
generating documentation, providing pipelines for turning code into published libraries, and the like. Tons of capital goes into tech companies of all stripes, AI companies, IOT companies, concept-based companies and the 
lot. Some succeed, some fail, but all spend money on tools. I am trying to capitalize on the imminent spike in demand.

It will be about 2 years before web assembly is fully integrated with .Net and ready for commercial use. Regardless of whether or not I manage to monetize my tools, what I learn will prepare me for building products based on web assembly 
and .Net. In other words, I am also preparing to make the most of web assembly's rise. Eventually, I intend to have a go at building component libraries and 
tools for building component libraries using web assembly and .Net. 

#### Current Projects
**[Mimo](https://github.com/JeremyTCD/Mimo)**  
This is a tool for generating documentation/blogs. I am working on this first because I need it to generate documentation for my other projects. It should be released in a month or two.

**[IClapp](https://github.com/JeremyTCD/DotNet.CommandLine)**  
IClapp is a technical library. It is complete and will be published after I generate documentation for it. Quickwrap and PiplinesCE depend on it. 

**[OpenPatterns](https://github.com/JeremyTCD/DotNet.Analyzers)**  
Autocorrect for programming patterns. Currently functional and in use with my other projects, but requires a rewrite and documentation before it can be published.

**Quickwrap**  
Quickwrap is a technical tool. I haven't started building it yet, but I've designed it and have concrete plans for it.

**[PipelinesCE](https://github.com/JeremyTCD/PipelinesCE)**  
PipelinesCE is a [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) tool. Basically, it provides a framework for reusable pipelines. This project is mostly complete but is held up by Mimo, IClapp and Quickwrap. A German guy 
recently released a decent alternative. PipelinesCE does have some features that his does not. I intend to publish PipelinesCE by the end of the year. With some work, this project might be monetizable.

**DocGen**  
Haven't started on this project yet, almost certainly will only be able to begin on it next year. Improves upon Mimo and will likely be monetizable.

#### Monetization and Finances
At this point, my primary goal (finances wise) is to be able to sustainably pay for an environment that is conducive to my work, study, and recovery. 

At present, assuming I maintain my current environment, I have enough savings to last me 1 to 1.5 years. To improve both this buffer and my environment, I am planning to try and generate some income using advertisements. The following 
are documentation sites for some popular libraries: [HTML Agility Pack](http://html-agility-pack.Net/from-file), [Newtonsoft](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Introduction.htm). Both run ads. Further down the road, I intend 
to monetize some of my tools by providing extra services.

#### Following My Progress
You can visit my [Github page](https://github.com/JeremyTCD) to see what I've been up to. The green squares correspond to days, you can click them to see what I did on a given day.

### Back-Up Plan
As a teen, my bet was that computing would be in demand in the coming decades. Computing provides tangible value to companies. For example, many companies have ventured online because it widens their 
customer base and provides convenience. This is in contrast to the biotech fad. That entire industry was propped up by government support rather than market forces. I was confident that I would be able to
find freelance jobs or a full-time job if my resources ran low. 

Things have panned out as expected. Computing is the [most in-demand](https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/) field in Singapore. At the same time, it affords close to the 
[highest starting pay](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/starting-pay-for-fresh-uni-grads-hits-new-high) for fresh grads. Moreover, Singapore is trying to attract companies that can compete with the big boys,
who pay entry-level workers [6 figures](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/d2f8987b/Google-Inc.-Entry-Level). While I do not have a degree, with my simple lifestyle, I am confident that over a reasonable
amount of time, I can earn enough to fund several more years of development.

## Risk Factors
### Health Issues
My health issues began when I was 17. I was trying to qualify for the SEA games for one last hurrah. Trainings were at night and I often got home past 11. I would eat and immediately go to bed so that I could wake up for school
the next morning. As a result, I started getting acid reflux. My throat was sore all the time. Back then, I had no idea that the soreness was due to acid. As a result,
I went on at least 6 courses of antibiotics over a year. This was a mistake. Antibiotics can mess up bacteria in the gut, which can lead to problems like excessive gas. I still remember the first time I woke up and 
simply could not breathe because of how bloated my stomach was. I did not save any photos, but [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV4SLLeDgvI/?taken-by=alycecrawford) poor girl had the same issue and documented her experience 
on Instagram. Note how her stomach is *taut*, it is distended with gas, she isn't fat. When bloating gets this bad, the diaphragm gets inhibited and it becomes hard to breathe. Apart from breathing issues, excessive gas makes 
it hard for the body to absorb nutrients (it affects appetite) and makes it incredibly hard to sleep. My health got incredibly bad, for several years, my mind was constantly on my next breathe and my mind was cloudy from the
malnutrition and sleep deprivation. I came close to death a number of times, waking up frozen, blind, and not breathing, I feared falling asleep. Sure enough, I eventually ended up warded with a failing heart.

It has been a long recovery. The ailment I have is often referred to as [IBS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016). If you scroll down in the IBS link, under 
causes you will see *changes in bacteria in the gut*. This *cause* wasn't always there. Back when I first came down with it, many doctors thought IBS was solely due to stress and that "reducing stress" was the way 
to cure it. This understanding of the ailment has changed over time. With this understanding has come remedies: 
- Foods that gas producing bacteria ferment have been identified. FODMAP is an acronym for the chemicals that can be fermented into gas. [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/ccs/gastroenterology/fodmap) has 
spearheaded the study of FODMAPs, creating the low-FODMAPs diet. 
- Sometime after I was diagnosed, Rifaximin, an antibiotic, was approved for the treatment of IBS in Singapore. [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610260/) study elaborates on its efficacy. Essentially, it is a 
slow releasing antibiotic that clears out bacteria in the gut, allowing for a gut bacteria "reset". 
- The [elemental diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992438) has been found to help. This powder diet includes only the most basic compounds. For example, instead of proteins, it includes only amino acids (usually,
the body breaks proteins down into amino acids). Because of this, the powder is completely absorbed within the first few feet of the small intestine, denying sustenance for bacteria in the rest of the gut.

Rifaxmin, probiotics, the FODMAP diet and the elemental diet have helped me to get to a functional state. The girl I mentioned managed to fix her issue by going on the low-FODMAP diet. She still gets some 
[bloating](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeDAjTBD6Bl/?taken-by=alycecrawford) if she deviates from the diet. My current condition is somewhat similar to hers, these days I am fine as long as my diet is controlled. In fact,
last year I felt close to perfect. Unfortunately, after eating out a couple of times in Malaysia, my state of health began to deteriorate. It will be a while more before my digestive system recovers to the point whereby it is
robust enough for me to take on jobs or commitments that require me to have meals out or at different times than I am used to. There is no doubt at all that I am getting better - for the last few years,
I've felt better every year - that said, my health is still a major risk factor for my plan. 

## Conclusion
I hope this article makes it easier to understand my actions and choices. Questions like:
- What I am doing on the computer all day long
- Why I "scringed" in the past and saved all my money
- Why I am so particular about my diet

should have clear answers. Thanks for reading!

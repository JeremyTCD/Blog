# about
My name is Jeremy Tan and I'm a software developer based in Singapore. I enjoy designing and 
building systems. Turning a speck in my mind's eye into a tangible,
working system brings me unparalleled satisfaction. I admire rational, level headed people who see
the bigger picture. I try my best to be such a person. Thanks for visiting my blog and for 
taking the time to read through this drivel. I hope it has been useful 
in some way. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you think an article can be improved upon!

# about
My name is Jeremy Tan and I'm a software developer based in Singapore. I enjoy designing and 
building systems. Turning a speck in my mind's eye into a tangible,
working system brings me deep satisfaction. I admire humble, rational people who see
the bigger picture. I try my best to be such a person. Thanks for visiting my blog, I hope it has been useful 
in some way. Feel free to submit a pull request if you think an article can be improved upon!

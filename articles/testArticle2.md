# Test article 2

*DocFX* is an API documentation generator for .NET, and currently it supports C# and VB.
It generates API reference documentation from triple-slash comments in your source code.
It also allows you to use Markdown files to create additional topics such as tutorials and how-tos, and to customize the generated reference documentation.
*DocFX* builds a static HTML website from your source code and Markdown files, which can be easily hosted on any web servers (for example, *github.io*).
Also, *DocFX* provides you the flexibility to customize the layout and style of your website through templates.
If you are interested in creating your own website with your own styles, you can follow [how to create custom template](testArticle1.md) to create custom templates.

*DocFX* also has the following cool features:

* Integration with your source code. You can click "View Source" on an API to navigate to the source code in GitHub (your source code must be pushed to GitHub).
* Cross-platform support. We have both exe version that runs under Windows and a .NET Core version that runs cross platform.
* Integration with Visual Studio. You can seamlessly use *DocFX* within Visual Studio.
* Markdown extensions. We introduced *DocFX Flavored Markdown(DFM)* to help you write API documentation. DFM is *100%* compatible with *GitHub Flavored Markdown(GFM)* with some useful extensions, like *file inclusion*, *code snippet*, *cross reference*, and *yaml header*.
For detailed description about DFM, please refer to [DFM](testArticle3.md).
